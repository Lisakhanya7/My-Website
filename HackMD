## Instructions  

Now that you have finished creating your first simple personal portfolio, make it **responsive** and ensure that it passes through a **linter**.  
You should make changes to the **same portfolio** you created — do not make a new one.  

- Develop your HTML and CSS in a logical way with **good naming conventions**, so another developer can easily understand and build upon your code.  
- Use **Semantic Markup** → [Read about it here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html).  
- Validate your HTML with this tool → [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).  
- Organize and name your files/folders in a **logical manner**.  

When done, submit the **GitHub Pages link** of your updated portfolio (not the repo link).
